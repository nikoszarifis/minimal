I am a first year PhD student at the [Computer Sciences
Department](http://cs.wisc.edu) of University of Wisconsin-Madison and a part
of the [Theory of Computing Group](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/theory/).
I am very lucky to be advised by Professor [Ilias
Diakonikolas](http://iliasdiakonikolas.org). I completed my undergraduate studies
at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the [National
Technical University of Athens](http://www.ntua.gr/en) in Greece, where I was advised
by Professor [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/).

I am interested in algorithms and in theoretical machine learning. You can find my CV [here](./assets/img/cv.pdf).
